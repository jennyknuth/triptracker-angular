#Trip Tracker Online

A web application for Boulder Valley School District's Trip Tracker program that rewards kids for taking alternative transportation to school.

Trip Tracker Online aims to provide a fun and engaging way for students to record their trips and chart their progress. It uses strategic color coding and data-driven graphics.  
See a live demo here: http://development.triptracker.divshot.io/#/

The back end is in a separate repo found here: It serves up the data from mongoDB to an API via an Express/Node.js server. 

On the front end, a thick AngularJS client allows users to view, create, edit, and delete their trips.

Charts are D3.js custom directives in AngularJS.
